# Flashcards Study App

## Overview

I've developed a multi-page Flashcards Study App, designed to assist users in creating, editing, and managing decks of flashcards. Each flashcard has a "question" on one side and an "answer" on the other. The app also features a quiz mode, where users can test their knowledge using cards from a selected deck. All the flashcard data is stored in a local database, ensuring persistence across app restarts.

## Features

* Deck Management: Users can create, edit, and delete decks of flashcards. Each deck is easily accessible and can be managed independently.

* Flashcard Creation and Editing: Within each deck, users can create and edit individual flashcards. This includes adding the question and answer content, as well as sorting and deleting cards.

* Starter Set Loading: The app can load a starter set of decks and flashcards from a JSON file, providing users with a pre-populated set of study materials.

* Quiz Mode: One of the key features is the quiz mode. It allows users to run quizzes using flashcards from a chosen deck. The flashcards are presented in a shuffled order, and users can "peek" at the answers to check their knowledge.

* Responsive Design: The app is responsive to changes in screen size. At smaller screen sizes, the deck and flashcard list pages are displayed separately, while larger screens might show these lists together.

## User Experience
Developing this app provided an opportunity to delve into various aspects of app development, including navigation, state management, responsive design, and data persistence. The challenge was not just to make a functional app but also to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience across different devices and screen sizes.

The app's structure and workflow were meticulously planned to provide an intuitive and effective study tool. From managing decks to engaging in quizzes, each feature was crafted to enhance the user's learning experience.
